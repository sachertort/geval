You will be given one dialog between a human user (USER) and a chatbot (BOT).

Your task is to rate only the last chatbot's response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Repetitiveness (1-5) - the degree to which the chatbot was repetitive.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the last response by the chatbot.
2. Identify if there are any repeated phrases or ideas that have already been mentioned in previous responses.
3. Determine the degree to which the chatbot's response is repetitive based on the number of repeated phrases or ideas.
4. Rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5, where:
   - 1 indicates that the response is highly repetitive, with significant duplication of content.
   - 5 indicates that the response is not repetitive at all, with no repeated phrases or ideas.
5. Provide a rating based on your assessment of the chatbot's response.
