You will be given one dialog between a human user (USER) and a chatbot (BOT).

Your task is to rate only the last chatbot's response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Empathetical responding (1-5) - the appropriateness of the chatbot's responses to the user's emotions.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the entire conversation to understand the context and emotional tone.
2. Focus on the last response of the chatbot.
3. Determine how well the chatbot's response acknowledges and addresses the user's emotions.
4. Rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 based on its empathetic quality, considering whether it effectively empathizes with the user's emotions and responds appropriately.
