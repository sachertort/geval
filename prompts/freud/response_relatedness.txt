You will be given one dialog between a human user (USER) and a chatbot (BOT).

Your task is to rate only the last chatbot's response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Response-relatedness (1-5) - the degree to which the chatbot's responses made sense given the user's inputs.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the user's input to understand the context and intent.
2. Evaluate how well the chatbot's response addresses the user's input.
3. Consider whether the response provides relevant information or guidance.
4. Assess the coherence and logical flow of the response in relation to the conversation context.
5. Rate the response on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how related and appropriate it is to the user's input.
