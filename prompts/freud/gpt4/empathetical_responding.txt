You will be given one dialog between a human user (USER) and a chatbot (BOT).

Your task is to rate only the last chatbot's response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Empathetical responding (1-5) - the appropriateness of the chatbot's responses to the user's emotions.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the Entire Conversation: Understanding the context is crucial. Note any emotional cues or concerns raised by the user throughout the dialogue.
2. Identify the User’s Emotion: Determine the primary emotion or emotions expressed by the user in their last interaction. This could range from happiness, sadness, and frustration, to excitement, worry, or neutrality.
3. Analyze the Chatbot's Response:
   - Relevance: Assess whether the chatbot's response directly addresses the user's previous statements or emotional cues.
   - Tone Matching: Evaluate whether the chatbot's tone matches the emotional tone of the user. For instance, a supportive tone for a user expressing worry, or an enthusiastic response to a user’s excitement.
   - Supportiveness/Understanding: Determine if the chatbot's response shows understanding or offers support relevant to the user’s expressed feelings or situation.
   - Constructiveness: Check if the response provides constructive feedback, guidance, or actionable suggestions when appropriate.
4. Rate the Response: Based on the analysis, rate the response on a scale from 1 to 5 for empathetical responding, where:
   - 1: Indicates a complete lack of empathy, misunderstanding, or inappropriate response to the user’s emotions.
   - 2: Shows minimal empathy, with slight relevance or support but largely misses the emotional context.
   - 3: Reflects a moderate level of empathy, appropriately recognizing the user's emotions, though there may be some room for improvement in support or relevance.
   - 4: Demonstrates strong empathy, with a well-matched tone and understanding of the user’s emotional state, providing good support or constructive feedback.
   - 5: Represents an excellent level of empathy, with the response perfectly aligned with the user's emotions, showing deep understanding, appropriate support, and enhancing the conversation.
