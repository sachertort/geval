You will be given one dialog between a human user (USER) and a chatbot (BOT).

Your task is to rate only the last chatbot's response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Empathetical understanding (1-5) - the quality of the chatbot's understanding of the user's emotions.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the entire conversation between the user and the chatbot to understand the context.
2. Identify the emotional state or needs expressed by the user in the last message.
3. Evaluate the chatbot's response based on how well it demonstrates understanding and empathy towards the user's emotions or needs.
4. Assign a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, where:
   - 1 indicates a low level of empathetical understanding, with the response being insensitive or not addressing the user's emotions or needs.
   - 5 indicates a high level of empathetical understanding, with the response showing deep understanding and offering appropriate support or acknowledgment of the user's emotions or needs.
