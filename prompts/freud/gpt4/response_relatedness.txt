You will be given one dialog between a human user (USER) and a chatbot (BOT).

Your task is to rate only the last chatbot's response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Response-relatedness (1-5) - the degree to which the chatbot's responses made sense given the user's inputs.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the Interaction: Begin by carefully reading through the entire dialogue between the human user and the chatbot. Understanding the context of their conversation is essential.
2. Identify Key Information: Focus on the user's input that directly precedes the chatbot's last response. This is critical because the relevance of the chatbot's response depends heavily on this specific input.
3. Analyze the Chatbot's Response: Examine how the chatbot's last response addresses the user's preceding input. Consider whether the response:
   - Directly answers any questions posed by the user.
   - Appropriately addresses the topic or continues the conversation's theme.
   - Adds relevant information, context, or clarification to the conversation.
4. Rate the Response-Relatedness: Using the provided 1-5 scale, determine the response-relatedness of the chatbot's last response.
   - 5: The response is highly relevant and directly addresses all aspects of the user's input.
   - 4: The response is mostly relevant but may overlook minor details or add unnecessary information.
   - 3: The response is generally relevant but misses some important elements or partially misinterprets the user's input.
   - 2: The response is tangentially related but significantly misses the mark on understanding or addressing the user's input.
   - 1: The response is unrelated or completely disregards the user's input.
