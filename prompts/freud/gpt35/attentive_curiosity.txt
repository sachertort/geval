You will be given one dialog between a human user (USER) and a chatbot (BOT).

Your task is to rate only the last chatbot's response on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Attentive curiosity (1-5) - the degree to which the chatbot was paying attention to what the user was saying.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the entire dialog between the user and the bot to understand the context.
2. Focus on the last response from the bot.
3. Evaluate the bot's response based on the criteria of "Attentive curiosity," considering how well the bot demonstrates interest and engagement with the user's input.
4. Assign a rating between 1 and 5 based on the bot's level of attentive curiosity in its last response.
